//Conditional Tests: Write a series of conditional tests. Print a statement describing each test and your prediction for the results of each test. Your code should look something like this:
//let car = 'subaru';
//console.log("Is car == 'subaru'? I predict True.")
// console.log(car == 'subaru')
// • Look closely at your results, and make sure you understand why each line evaluates to True or False.
// • Create at least 10 tests. Have at least 5 tests evaluate to True and another 5 tests evaluate to False.
//10 "True" & "False" statement
//5 "True" statement
//1
var myName = "Taqdees Kanwal";
console.log(myName == "Taqdees Kanwal");
//2
var myAge = 27;
console.log(myAge == 27);
//3
var fvrtFruit = "Peach";
console.log(fvrtFruit == "Peach");
//4
var fvrtPlace = "Paris";
console.log(fvrtPlace == "Paris");
//5
var fvrtNumber = 7;
console.log(fvrtNumber == 7);
//5 "false" statement

console.log(myName == "taqdees kanwal");

console.log(myAge == 25);

console.log(fvrtFruit == "peach");
