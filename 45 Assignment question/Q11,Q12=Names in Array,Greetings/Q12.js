//Greetings: Start with the array you used in Exercise 11, but instead of just printing each person’s name, print a message to them. The text of each message should be the same, but each message should be personalized with the person’s name.
var names2 = ["Abdullah", "Taskeen", "Saifullah"];
var message = "Did you learn today?";
for (var i = 0; i < names2.length; i++) {
    console.log("hello!", names2[i], message);
}
